# M-O-BLE
iOS app for controlling an Arduino bot "M-O" over Bluetooth LE. Hence, M-O BLE.


I'm building a replica of the friendly cleaner bot "M-O" from the film "Wall-e" that is currently envisioned as being 3D printed 
and driven by 3 Arduino Mega processors.

M-O-BLE is an iOS app that sends and receives messages to the main Arduino in the bot over Bluetooth.
